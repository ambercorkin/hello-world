# hello-world
my practice repository

Hi, everyone! I'm Amber and I've begun my coding journey! I have already completed the jumpstart program, and I am just beginning to start the application process for Ada Developers Academy. Wish me luck! :)

Random facts about me: I have a birthmark in the shape of the Nike swoosh, I have bicycled across America, I'm an identical twin, and I've eaten frog legs.
